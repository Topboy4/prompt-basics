Exercise 3: Parameter Experimentation
Use the same prompt with temperature = 0.2 and then with temperature = 0.9.

ANSWER:
Temperature = 0.9

Artificial intelligence is transforming healthcare in exciting ways. From spotting tiny patterns in X-rays that even experienced doctors might miss to predicting disease outbreaks before they spread, AI is pushing medicine into a smarter era. It can personalize treatments, speed up drug discovery, and even power virtual health assistants that support patients 24/7. While challenges remain, AI opens the door to a more proactive and data-driven healthcare system.

Temperature = 0.2

Artificial intelligence improves healthcare by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, assisting in medical imaging analysis, optimizing treatment plans, and improving administrative efficiency. AI systems can analyze large datasets to identify patterns, support early disease detection, and reduce human error. Additionally, AI contributes to personalized medicine by tailoring treatments based on patient data.

Repeat with different top-p values (e.g., 0.5 vs 1).

ANSWER:

Top-p 0.5 : AI improves healthcare through better diagnosis, predictive analytics, and efficient patient management. It helps detect diseases earlier, supports decision-making, and reduces administrative workload.

Top 1 : AI enhances healthcare by improving diagnostic precision, accelerating medical research, supporting robotic surgeries, optimizing hospital workflows, and enabling personalized treatment strategies. It can analyze complex datasets to uncover hidden trends, predict patient risks, and support continuous monitoring through wearable technologies.

Record how the style, randomness, and focus of responses change.

ANSWER:

this experiment demonstrates that parameter tuning directly influences response diversity, tone, and focus. Lower values produce controlled and consistent outputs, while higher values increase creativity and variability. Understanding these parameters allows better control over AI-generated responses depending on the intended use case (e.g., academic writing vs. creative tasks).
