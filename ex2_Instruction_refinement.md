Exercise 2: Instruction Refinement
Start with a vague request like: “Tell me about AI.”

ANSWER:  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a field of computer science that focuses on creating machines that can perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. These tasks include problem-solving, learning, decision-making, language understanding, and pattern recognition. AI is used in various applications such as virtual assistants, recommendation systems, self-driving cars, healthcare diagnostics, and robotics. It includes subfields like machine learning, natural language processing, and computer vision.

Refine it step by step into a clear instruction, e.g.,

  “Explain AI in simple terms for beginners.”
  “Summarize the main AI techniques in 5 bullet points.”

  Artificial Intelligence (AI) is when computers are designed to think and learn in ways similar to humans. Instead of just following fixed instructions, AI systems can learn from data and improve over time. For example, when Netflix suggests movies you might like or when your phone understands your voice, that is AI in action. In simple terms, AI helps machines make smart decisions based on information they receive.

Machine Learning – Systems learn patterns from data and improve over time.

Deep Learning – A subset of machine learning using neural networks with many layers.

Natural Language Processing (NLP) – Enables machines to understand and generate human language.

Computer Vision – Allows machines to interpret and analyze visual information.

Reinforcement Learning – Systems learn by trial and error using rewards and penalties.

Compare outputs and note differences.

ANSWER: The vague prompt produced a general overview without specific structure or audience targeting. The beginner-focused prompt simplified the explanation and adjusted tone and complexity. The final prompt introduced formatting constraints, resulting in a structured, concise answer limited to five bullet points.
